Python Web Automation Script
This Python script automates tasks using Selenium WebDriver and Microsoft Edge. It also utilizes libraries such as tkinter, zipfile, and others to manage various tasks. Follow the steps below to set up, install dependencies, and run the script.

Features
Web Automation: Uses Selenium WebDriver with Microsoft Edge to automate web browsing.
UI: Uses tkinter for creating a simple GUI (if included in the script).
File Handling: Utilizes zipfile for managing compressed files.
Regex & Time: Uses re for pattern matching and time for handling delays or waiting.
Requirements
Before running the script, ensure you have the following:

Python 3.x: The script requires Python version 3.x.
Libraries: The script uses several libraries, which need to be installed:
selenium (for web automation)
tkinter (for GUI, if applicable)
zipfile, re, time, os (standard libraries in Python)
Microsoft Edge WebDriver: To run Selenium with Microsoft Edge, you'll need the corresponding Edge WebDriver.
Setup Instructions
1. Install Python
Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can download it from the official website:
Python Download

When installing Python, make sure to check the box "Add Python to PATH" during the installation process.

2. Install Dependencies
After installing Python, you need to install the required Python libraries. Open a terminal or Command Prompt and run the following commands:

bash
Code kopieren
pip install selenium
tkinter is usually included with Python by default, but if it is missing, you may need to install it manually:

For Linux:
bash
Code kopieren
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
For Windows/macOS, tkinter should already be available.
3. Download and Install Edge WebDriver
To use Selenium with Microsoft Edge, you need to install the Edge WebDriver that matches the version of Microsoft Edge installed on your machine.

Go to the Edge WebDriver Download Page.
Download the version that corresponds to your Edge version.
Extract the msedgedriver.exe file to a location on your computer.
4. Add Edge WebDriver to System PATH
To make it easier for Selenium to find the WebDriver, add the location of the msedgedriver.exe to your system's PATH:

Open System Properties (Right-click This PC > Properties).
Click Advanced system settings > Environment Variables.
Under System variables, find the Path variable and click Edit.
Add the folder where msedgedriver.exe is located to the PATH list.
Click OK to save the changes.
5. Running the Script
Open a Command Prompt or terminal.
Navigate to the directory where the script is located:
bash
Code kopieren
cd C:\path\to\your\script
Run the Python script:
bash
Code kopieren
python your_script.py
Troubleshooting
ModuleNotFoundError: If you encounter an error like ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'selenium', it means the required module is missing. Run pip install selenium to install it.

WebDriver issues: If you see an error related to the WebDriver, ensure that the msedgedriver.exe is correctly installed and its location is added to the system's PATH.

tkinter issues: If tkinter is not available, make sure you've installed it properly (for Linux, run sudo apt-get install python3-tk).
